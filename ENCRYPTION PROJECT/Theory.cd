Encryption is the process of changing readable information into a secret code so that no one else can understand it except the intended person.
Example:
HELLO → X7#K9


Decryption is the process of changing the secret code back into readable information so the original message can be understood.

Example:
X7#K9 → HELLO


Caesar Cipher encryption technique

Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted forward by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
You choose a number called a key (shift).

Example: Shift = 3

A → D

B → E

C → F

So the word:

HELLO → KHOOR

HELLO → KHOOR → Encryption   C = (P + Shift) mod 26


KHOOR → HELLO → Decryption   P = (C − Shift) mod 26
